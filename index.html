       <p> For me, frontend development is a real art, I want to relate to it and become part of the team that participates in product development, because I am interested in creating new projects, making the client part of these projects convenient, comfortable, understandable. Now I'm looking for a company where I can open up as much as possible and bring useful things from my experience:</p>
       <p> - The ability to quickly search for the necessary information will help to effectively cope with tasks.</p>
       <p> - Communication skills will help build partnerships with colleagues.</p>
       <p>- Self-organization and discipline will help you plan your tasks correctly and respect deadlines.</p>
       <p>I speak English at the B1 level. For professional development and expanding horizons in the field, I read thematic channels in telegram. </p>
